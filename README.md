"Recipe" HTML Website Practice

(5/17/2025)
I'm making this project to practice/brush up on my HTML skills. Please note that this is part of the self-paced WebDev path taught by The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/). I definitely recommend this website for beginners or CompSci students who've neglected to keep up their WebDev skills (like me, lol).
